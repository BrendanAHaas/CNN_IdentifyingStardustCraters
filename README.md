# CNN_IdentifyingStardustCraters
# The goal of this project is to automate the tedious search for impact craters on foil sample collectors on NASA's Stardust mission.

# NASA's Stardust spacecraft launched in 2004, flew through the coma of comet Wild 2, and returned with cometary material in 2006.
# Much of the cometary material impacted aluminum foils present on the Stardust sample collector at 6.1 km/s.
# However, much of the material was extremely small.  Most impact craters are around a micron in size (1/100th a human hair).
# Scanning Electron Microscopes scanned the foils in high resolution, generating thousands of high-resolution images.
# However, the vast majority of these images did not contain impact craters, and manually searching the images required many man hours.
# We hope to automate the search for impact craters on these images through the use of a convolutional neural network.
